Project Name: Calculator Solo

Effort: Somewhat difficult, for coding. It took several weeks/months to get it done. 

What's its for: Basic Calculator that can be used for operators such as +,-,*,/, exponents, logarithms, basic trig, factorials, and Mean and median. Does not accept variables(as most calculators don't), accepts integers(ex. 1, 2, 3, etc...).

How to use: Copy the source code given and then paste it to your java software(vscode for example). After that hit run and choose which class you would like to run. After choosing your class you will be given a calculator(visual) to input your numbers. After that your inputs will be solved and you will have a solution displayed. This code is very simple to run.
